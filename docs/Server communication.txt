Communication Protocol

Server to Client
1. Server connects to a client.
2. Server sends "Message" object to the client without any data
3. Client sends "Message" object to the server with args[0] = client's ID
4. Server verifies that the received ID is the same as the ID the server 
	expected.
    4.a. If ID was confirmed, the server sends "Message" object with 
    	args[1] = task
    4.b. If ID was not confirmed, the server closes connection.

Client to Server
When client application starts:
SYNC
1. Client connects to the server
2. Client sends "Message" object with:
    - reguest type: RequestType "SYNC"
    - arguments[0]: int actual ID if one has been assigned before or Constants.
    	NULL_ID if it's a new client.    
    - arguments[1]: int port number that the client is listening on
    - arguments[2]: ClientType type of the client (worker or client) if it's 
    	a new account. Server ignores this field if account id (argument[0]) is
    	found.
3. Server sends "Message" object with:
    - reguest type: RequestType "SYNC"
    - arguments[0]: int actual ID of the client. Client HAS to use this ID for any further communication.
NEW_TASK
When client wants to send a new task:
1. Client connects to the server
2. Client sends "Message" object.
3. Server sends back "Message" object with arguments[1] set to task's id
